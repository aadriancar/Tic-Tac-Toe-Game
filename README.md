# About

This repository contains my first independent project outside of classes, being the game "Tic-Tac-Toe." This was created shortly after the completion of my first coding course, which taught me the basics of programming in Java.

## Playing the Game

The game was intended to be played by 2 players through the console by running the game.java file. After completing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, the program will ask you if you would like to play again.
